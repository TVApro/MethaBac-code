# MethaBac-code
Code for working with Methanobacteria genomes

Currently, a .txt file contains the commands I used for trimming and alignment of new MySeq reads to the genomes from NCBI, and a .sh file is a shell (bash) script abstracting the same commands.

Actually, I created it mainly to learn how to use named arguments in bash scripts :)
